<!-- API-EVANGELIST-PROVENANCE:BEGIN -->
> ### About this repository
>
> **This is not our API.** This repository is an independent, third-party profile of a company's
> **publicly available** API surface, maintained by [API Evangelist](https://apievangelist.com).
> API Evangelist does not operate, host, resell, or support this company's APIs, and is not
> affiliated with or endorsed by the company unless stated on the profile.
>
> **Where the information came from.** Everything here is assembled from material a member of the
> public can reach with a browser and no credentials — the company's own website, developer portal
> and documentation, the specifications it publishes for public use (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema,
> `apis.json`, `llms.txt` and similar), its public repositories, and its public status, pricing and
> changelog pages. **Nothing here is obtained by breaching a system, defeating an access control, or
> using credentials of any kind.**
>
> **The rating is an independent assessment.** The Kin Score and Agent Readiness rating are
> independently calculated scores of a company's *public* API artifacts, produced by API Evangelist
> against a published rubric. They are not certifications, endorsements, security assessments, or
> audits, and they score published artifacts — not the quality, safety, or security of the software.
>
> **Corrections, re-scores, and removal are free.** No partnership, contract, or purchase is
> required, and you do not need to justify the request.
>
> - **Something wrong?** Open an issue on this repository, or email
>   [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com).
> - **Published something new?** Ask for a re-score and we will re-run the rating.
> - **Want the listing taken down?** Say so and we will honor it. The profile is reduced to your
>   company name, a factual description, and a link to your own site, and the company is recorded as
>   **unrated** — never scored zero for having asked.
>
> **Response times.** Acknowledgement within **one business day**; removal or restriction within
> **two business days**; corrections and re-scores within **five business days**.
>
> **Not from the company, and here with a question?** You are welcome here — we would rather be the
> front line and point you the right way than have a good report go nowhere. What this repository
> can answer is narrow, though, so it is worth knowing who you are actually looking for:
>
> - **A question about how the API works, an account, billing, or a bug in the service** — that is
>   the company's own support, not us. We profile this API; we do not operate it and cannot see
>   your account.
> - **A bug in an open-source project we only catalog** — file it on that project's own repository.
>   This has happened with a real and correct bug report that reached us instead of the people who
>   could fix it, which helped nobody.
> - **Anything about this listing itself** — the description, the tags, the rating, a missing or
>   wrong artifact — is ours. Open an issue here.
> - **Not sure, or something general about API Evangelist or APIs.io** — open an issue on the
>   [APIs.io Inbox](https://github.com/api-search/inbox) and we will route it.
>
> **This repository contains no software, and we will never ask you to download anything.** There is
> no build, release, installer, or binary here — only text and machine-readable API descriptions, so
> there is nothing here that can be "corrupt" or need "repairing". Any issue, comment, or email
> claiming otherwise and offering a download link is not from us and is hostile. Do not follow the
> link; it is a lure. Report it to GitHub and, if you like, tell us at
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) so we can take it down.
>
> **On a security or compliance team?** Email
> [info@apievangelist.com](mailto:info@apievangelist.com) with *security* in the subject line and
> you will get a person, not a form. We will tell you exactly which public URLs this profile was
> built from so your team can see the same surface we did, and we will take the listing down on
> request while you work through it.

Onlia is a Canadian digital insurance brokerage, operating as the registered business name of Onlia Agency Inc. and backed by Southampton Financial Inc. (the Southampton group of companies). It sells personal lines direct to consumers online and by phone — auto (car, motorcycle, ATV, snowmobile, trailer, motorhome), property (home, condo, tenant, landlord, second home, mobile home) and lifestyle lines (boat, pet, life, travel, seasonal) — plus group and bundle programs. Onlia does not underwrite; it places business with a panel of Canadian carriers disclosed publicly on its broker-disclosure page, including Aviva, Gore Mutual, Economical/Definity, Pembridge, Pafco, Echelon, Wawanesa, Unica, Forward, Premier, Facility Association (Intact) and APOLLO. Its home market is Canada, concentrated in Ontario, where market conduct sits with FSRA while OSFI supervises the federally-regulated carriers behind the policies. API posture, recorded honestly: Onlia publishes NO public developer portal and NO self-serve API. developer., developers., docs. and api. under onlia.ca do not resolve, and /developers, /api, /developer and /integrations on the marketing site all return 404. The only quote/bind/issue/FNOL surface is app.onlia.ca, a consumer-facing Angular single-page app running on a white-labelled Ignite Insurance policy administration platform whose backend is private to the app. The one "partner" page is a B2B marketing page inviting affinity discount partnerships by email, with no technical onboarding. No ACORD, AL3, ACORD XML or NGDS reference appears anywhere on the public site. The app's own bundle shows the private backend runs on MuleSoft Anypoint CloudHub ESB services (auto and home policy, authentication, documents, VIN/MVR, claims) plus an Ignite Insurance authentication service — real REST plumbing behind the SPA, but undocumented, uncredentialed and not offered to third parties, so no API entry is claimed here.

The rubric is published at [github.com/api-evangelist/kin-score](https://github.com/api-evangelist/kin-score). The per-check breakdown behind these numbers — which checks were earned, partial or missed — along with score history and how this provider compares to its peers, is available at [apis.io/providers/onlia/](https://apis.io/providers/onlia/).

## How this profile is made

API Evangelist profiles a company's public API surface the way a developer would find it: the website, developer portal and documentation, the specifications it publishes, its public repositories, and its pricing, status and changelog pages. From that it derives the properties above — contracts split per API, workflows, schemas, collections, governance rules, plans and rate limits — and scores them against the published [Kin Score rubric](https://github.com/api-evangelist/kin-score).

The artifacts are published on [APIs.io](https://apis.io), not in this repository. This repository is the public record for Onlia: the place to say something is wrong, missing or out of date, and to ask for a re-score or a removal.
